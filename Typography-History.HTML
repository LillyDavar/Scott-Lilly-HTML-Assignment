      <p>The font "Fira Coda" was created somewhere around 2019 by Nikita Prokopov from Germany. The font was created to be used by programers and would be considered a "Terminal Font". </p>
      <p>The is designed to make characters used by programers easier to distinguish at a glance. One example is the -> character.</p>

      <p>As written on the Fonts about section on "Google Fonts" "Fira Code is an extension of the Fira Mono font containing a set of ligatures for common programming multi-character combinations. This is just a font rendering feature: underlying code remains ASCII-compatible. This helps to read and understand code faster. For some frequent sequences like .. or //, ligatures allow us to correct spacing."
<!-- The Font was made in 2019? Thought it was older when I started working on this project -->
